In this class, I completed three assignments and a group project

* In Assignment 1, we analyzed Edmunds forum data identifying similar vehicle brands utilizing similarity analysis and MDS mapping

* In Assignment 2, we scraped data from Amazon reviews about shoes and identified product attributes and recommendations

* In Assignment 3, we scraped data from an intragram page to identify the most successful post topics 

* In our final project, we completed a sentiment analysis of Biden and Trump tweets in different states to identify topics of interest during the 2020 election
